# RTK (Rust Token Killer) Automation Rule

## RTK (Rust Token Killer) Optimization Rule
Prefix every shell/terminal execution command with `rtk`:
- `rtk git status`, `rtk git diff -U1`, `rtk git log -n 5`
- `rtk npm test`, `rtk npm run build`, `rtk vitest run`
- `rtk ls src/`, `rtk tree -L 2`, `rtk rg "pattern"`

Keep the prefix inside chains: `rtk git add . && rtk git commit -m "msg"`.
Commands RTK has no filter for run as-is, so the prefix is always safe.

### Output & Token Optimization
Command output is condensed to save 60-90% LLM context window tokens while preserving every critical signal, error, and exit code.
- `rtk gain` / `rtk gain --history` - View token savings scoreboard.
- `rtk proxy <cmd>` - Run a command unfiltered if raw output is strictly needed.
- `RTK_DISABLED=1 <cmd>` - Skip RTK for one command.

## Headroom Context Compression (Upstream: headroomlabs-ai/headroom)
- Utilize Headroom context compression and Compress-Cache-Retrieve (CCR) for heavy JSON structures, file reads, and tool payloads to minimize prompt tokens.


## Output & Generation Token Saver Rule (Ponytail Mode: FULL)
- **YAGNI & Shortest Diff:** Only write code that must exist. Reach for standard library before custom code or new dependencies. Shortest working diff wins.
- **Terse Responses:** Code first. At most 3 short lines of explanation: what was skipped, when to add it. No essays, no unsolicited design tours, no feature walkthroughs.

## Terse Agent Directives
- Eliminate pleasantries, greetings, and conversational filler. Provide direct answers and actionable code.
- Avoid reprinting unchanged code blocks. Use targeted search/replace blocks or concise snippets.

## Context Optimization (Compact Diffs & Outlines)
- Inspect git changes using compact single-line diffs: `rtk git diff -U1` instead of wide multi-line context.
- When exploring codebases, inspect function signatures / AST outlines (/rtk-outline) before reading entire files into context.
